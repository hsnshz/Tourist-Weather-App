**iOS Weather & Touristic Application**

**Description:**
As part of my coursework for the Mobile Native Development module, I developed a SwiftUI-based tourist utility app that provides real-time weather information and highlights tourist attractions on a map. This project demonstrates my technical skills in mobile app development and my commitment to creating practical, user-friendly applications. 

**Key Features:**
- **Current Weather Display:** Displays current weather conditions for specified locations using the OpenWeatherMap API, with the initial display set to London.
- **Detailed Weather Forecast:** Provides hourly weather updates for the next 48 hours and daily summaries for the next 8 days.
- **Interactive Map:** Features an interactive map with pins indicating tourist attractions, updating based on the selected city.
- **Location-Based Updates:** Automatically updates weather and tourist information for the selected location.
- **Consistent UI/UX:** Adheres to Apple's design guidelines for a seamless user experience.
